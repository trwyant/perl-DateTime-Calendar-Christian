    Add rt.cpan.org back to bug reporting methods. Long live RT!

    Correct GitHub ticket link.

    Get prerequisites up to snuff and add xt/author/prereq.t to ensure
    they stay that way.

    - Add modules provided to the metadata. This is done only if
      Module::Metadata can be loaded.

    - Repackage licenses into LICENSE/ directory

    - Implement full DateTime interface. Unless I missed something.

    - Better validation on reform dates (I hope!), plus more ways to
      specify.

    - Add method calendar_name, and override strftime() so that
      calendar_name() can appear in a template.

    - Add author tests for various desiderata,

    - Convert from DateTime language interface to DateTime locale
      interface.

    - Require Perl 5.008004, since DateTime does.

    - Add today() constructor, with same caveats as truncate().

    - Document reform date location names.

    - Add Tom Wyant to author and copyright notices.

    - Use warnings.

    - DateTime 0.14 introduced some incompatible changes.
      Updated DT::C::Christian to this new DateTime version.

    - If new() is passed a date which is one of the missing days (during
      a calendar transform), this is now interpreted as a proleptic
      Gregorian date; this means that the returned date is now *before*
      the calendar change, instead of *after* the change.

    - added nanosecond support, by requiring DateTime 0.10

    - a change in DateTime caused a failure of a test script (t/08math.t
      again); fortunately it was in a TODO block; replaced that by
      todo_skip

    - how embarrassing - there's a bug in t/08math.t ... now fixed, of
      course

    - added a number of calendar reform dates; there are now 41 of them
      included

	- original version (still buggy, probably)
